# FITS (File Information Tool Set)

The File Information Tool Set (FITS) identifies, validates and extracts technical metadata for a wide range of file formats.

It acts as a wrapper, which means running FITS actually means you are starting and managing the output from several other open source tools.

Output from these tools are converted into a common format, compared to one another and consolidated into a single XML output file.

FITS is written in Java and is **compatible with Java 1.7 or higher.**
