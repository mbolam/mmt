# Data Accessioner

The Data Accessioner(DA)) is a simple tool, with an easy-to-use graphic interface, for migrating content between media while also:
* creating and validating checksums
* gathering metadata (viaFITS),
* compiling an XML metadata file (with the option to include Dublin Core metadata as of v 1.0) for future reference.
