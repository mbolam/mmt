# When to Convert Files

We convert files when a use case requires the metadata to be in another form. For example, if we start out with an Excel file of Dublin Core metadata that we need to convert to MARC and upload into our ILS or LSP, there are about 4 different file format conversions we will need to undertake in order to get from start to finish.

Tools like MarcEdit, pymarc, OpenRefine, and XSLT can be used to convert metadata files.
