## Using MarcEdit Tools

### Batch Process MARC Records

**Batch Process MARC Records** allows you to run one of the MARC Tools (for file conversion) on multiple files at a time.

### MARC Join

**MARC Join** is one of many MARC Processing Tools in MarcEdit. It allows users to join a set of files into a single file.

### Record Depulication

**Record Deduplication** can find duplicate records across multiple files or within a single file.

### Add/Delete Field

**Add/Delete Field** allows you to add or delete an entire field across all records in the MarcEdit Mnemonic file (.mrk).

### Special Undo

**Special Undo** allows you to undo ONE and ONLY ONE bulk action. The standard undo does not allow you to interact with batch actions.

### MARCValidator

In OCLC Connexion, you are able to validate MARC records against MARC21 Bibliographic Rules – you can also do this in MarcEdit using **MARCValidator**.

### Generate Call Numbers

**Generate Call Numbers** utilizes OCLC’s Classification web service to generate either Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress Headings
