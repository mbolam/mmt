# Metadata Management Tools for MARC

## MarcEdit - What is it?

Terry Reese created MarcEditin 1999 while at Oregon State University. Terry is now the Head of Digital Initiatives at Ohio State University.

MarcEdit operates on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

## Using MarcEdit Tools

### Batch Process MARC Records

* **Batch Process MARC Records** allows you to run one of the MARC Tools (for file conversion) on multiple files at a time.

### MARC Join

* **MARC Join** is one of many MARC Processing Tools in MarcEdit. It allows users to join a set of files into a single file.

### Record Depulication

* **Record Deduplication** can find duplicate records across multiple files or within a single file.

### Add/Delete Field

* **Add/Delete Field** allows you to add or delete an entire field across all records in the MarcEdit Mnemonic file (.mrk).

### Special Undo

* **Special Undo** allows you to undo ONE and ONLY ONE bulk action. The standard undo does not allow you to interact with batch actions.

### MARCValidator

* In OCLC Connexion, you are able to validate MARC records against MARC21 Bibliographic Rules – you can also do this in MarcEdit using **MARCValidator**.

### Generate Call Numbers

* **Generate Call Numbers** utilizes OCLC’s Classification web service to generate either Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress Headings

### Generate Cutter Numbers

* **Generate Cutters** uses order of preference to generate Cutters automatically.

## Regular Expressions in MarcEdit

### The power of Find & Replace

If there isn’t a feature to do exactly what you are trying to do, you may be able to use Find & Replace to get the job done. This can be very powerful when used with Regular Expressions.

### Regular Expressions

A **Regular Expression** or **regex** is a text string that describes a pattern that a regex engine uses in order to find text (or positions) in a body of text, typically for the purposes of validating, finding, replacing or splitting.

## Exporting and Importing Tab Delimited Text

The **Delimited Text Translator** maps fields in a delimited text file into a MARCXML or MARC file.

**Export Tab Delimited Records** maps fields in a .mrc or .mrk file, and exports into a .txt (Tab Delimited) file.
