# What is Metadata?

Metadata is “a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.”

Or

“Information about information”

## Types of Metadata

*Descriptive metadata* describes a resource for purposes such as discovery and identification. It can include elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.

*Structural metadata* indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters.

*Administrative metadata* provides information to help manage a resource, such as when and how it was created, file type and other technical information, and who can access it.
 * Technical metadata - For decoding and rendering files
 * Preservation metadata - Long-term management of files
 * Rights metadata - Intellectual property rights attached to content

# Where to start with metadata management?

The first step to managing your metadata is figuring out what type of metadata you have, where it’s going, and how to get it there.

In this section, we will learn about the following topics:
* What is metadata management?
* File types
* Extracting technical metadata (using Command Line and the File Information Toolset)
* File conversion (using Excel to export XML)
* File conversion (using MarcEdit)

## What is Metadata Management?
*"Metadata management is the administration of data that describes other data." -- [Margaret Rouse](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/metadata-management)*

Establishing policies and processes that ensure information can be:
* integrated
* accessed
* shared
* linked
* analyzed
* maintained

Metadata Standards define elements.
Content Standards tell you what and how to record those elements.

## Where do we start?

* What kind of metadata are we dealing with?
* What file types are we working with?
* Where is it going?

## Descriptive Metadata Scenario

## Technical Metadata Scenario 1

## Technical Metadata Scenario 2

## Administrative Metadata Scenario

## Discussion
What kind of workflows do you use for metadata management?
