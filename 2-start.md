# Where to start?

Where to start? Figuring out what type of metadata you have, where it’s going, and how to get it there

•	What is metadata management?
•	File types
•	Extracting technical metadata (using Command Line and the File Information Toolset)
•	File conversion (using Excel to export XML)
•	File conversion (using MarcEdit)
	•	Group discussion on what kind of workflows they use for metadata management
•	Students follow along with tutorials for MarcEdit, Excel XML export, Command Line and FITS technical metadata extraction after introduction of tools. 	•

Students should feel comfortable identifying what tools are available to convert files in their work.
