# Where to start?

The first step to managing your metadata is figuring out what type of metadata you have, where itâ€™s going, and how to get it there.

In this section, we will learn about the following topics:
* What is metadata management?
* File types
* Extracting technical metadata (using Command Line and the File Information Toolset)
* File conversion (using Excel to export XML)
* File conversion (using MarcEdit)

## What is Metadata Management?
*"Metadata management is the administration of data that describes other data." -- [Margaret Rouse](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/metadata-management)*

Establishing policies and processes that ensure information can be:
* integrated
* accessed
* shared
* linked
* analyzed

* What kind of metadata are we dealing with?
* What file types are we working with?
* Where is it going?


Metadata Standards define elements.
Content Standards tell you what and how to record those elements.

Group discussion on what kind of workflows they use for metadata management

Students follow along with tutorials for MarcEdit, Excel XML export, Command Line and FITS technical metadata extraction after introduction of tools.

Students should feel comfortable identifying what tools are available to convert files in their work.
