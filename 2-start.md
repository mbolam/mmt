The first step to managing your metadata is figuring out what type of metadata you have, where itâ€™s going, and how to get it there.

In this section, we will learn about the following topics:
* What is metadata management?
* File types
* Extracting technical metadata (using Command Line and the File Information Toolset)
* File conversion (using Excel to export XML)
* File conversion (using MarcEdit)

## What is Metadata Management?
*"Metadata management is the administration of data that describes other data." -- [Margaret Rouse](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/metadata-management)*

Establishing policies and processes that ensure information can be:
* integrated
* accessed
* shared
* linked
* analyzed

Metadata Standards define elements.
Content Standards tell you what and how to record those elements.

## Where do we start?
