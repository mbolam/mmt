# Metadata Management Tools
With so many tools available to catalogers and metadata workers, it can be difficult to keep up or know where to start! In this 4-hour workshop, participants will be introduced to tools such as OpenRefine, Regular Expressions, MarcEdit, and Python/Pymarc. Emphasis will be placed on how these different metadata management tools can be incorporated into workflows through hands-on activities, example use cases for each tool, and a survey of resources available. This workshop will also provide participants with an opportunity to ask questions and collaborate with each other to problem-solve metadata workflow issues they may be facing in their workplaces.

Metadata Management Tools is a workshop designed for library staff who regularly work manipulating MARC data and/or metadata sets as well as library school students interested in the subject of metadata management. A basic understanding of metadata standards (such as MARC or Dublin Core) and formatting will be helpful for this course.
